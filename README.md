This is a quick and simple extension to make it so that there is no default send address in Proton Mail.
It pretty much just disables the send button until a specific address is chosen.

Inspired by [this Reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ProtonMail/comments/vnhdyh/possibility_to_not_set_any_default_address/).

Will update with links to the Chrome and Firefox extension stores when it gets past the review process.
